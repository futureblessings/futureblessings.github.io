            The first gift I want to give to you (and one that you've already seen)
            is this website! I bought the domain through Name.com and I am currently
            hosting it on Github Pages for free. I can help you set up a Github Account
            and host the website on your account should you want to make any changes to it. I would
            also be more than happy to help you make what you want, but I
            know you can totally do it on your own (plus you're really artsy and have an
            awesome style that I wouldn't be able to replicate). Just let me know if there's any
            way I can help you!<br>
            The second gift I want to give to you (but is unfortunately at my dorm room) is 
            a star wars waffle maker! You really got me into star wars and I don't think that's 
            a bad thing at all, especially since we both like waffles! I can see us making some 
            waffles in the near future haha! <br>
            The third gift that I want to give to you is a minecraft kitty because I think he is 
            adorable and he kind of reminds me of the cats we have on minecraft! I know that he 
            isn't anywhere near as adorable and sweet as Penne but I hope that he can be there 
            for you when you need to squish someone and I'm not around!<br>
            Last but not least, I wanted to give you an envelope! What's in it is a surprise, but 
            I think you'll like it!<br>
            <br>
            Merry Christmas! I love you so much.

        You may ask, why another page? Because I messed up the last page and I had to make this one.
