    <ul class="slideshow">
        <li><span>
                <p>Before I give you your gift, I want to thank you for a few things.</p>
            </span></li>
        <li><span>
                <p>
                    Thank you for being a source of happiness in my life, even when we were apart.<br>
                    Whether it was you sending me cute snaps over Thanksgiving break (and this break)<br>
                    or you playing minecraft with me, I always felt cared for by you. You<br>
                    genuinely care about me and how I'm feeling and that always makes me happy.
                </p>
            </span></li>
        <li><span>
                <p>
                    Thank you for making me feel safe. Ever since I first stayed at your place<br>
                    overnight I've totally missed waking up to you and falling asleep in your arms.<br>
                    Waking up next to you was such a nice feeling but I feel just as safe and loved<br>
                    knowing that you're here in this world with me and I don't have to go through<br>
                    anything alone. I hope that whenever you feel stressed, worried, or down that<br>
                    I'm always here for you too. Your well-being will never be a burden for me and<br>
                    I will always love you no matter what happens in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for being such a cool person to spend time with. I'm normally a<br>
                    pretty forgetful person (as you can tell already), but I don't think I will<br>
                    forget the moments I've spent with you so far for a very long time. I might<br>
                    forget certain details, but I'll remember how cute and adorable you were when<br>
                    you saw snow falling down for the first time. You made my heart melt and I just<br>
                    wanted to hold your hand and kiss every freckle on your face. I also remember how<br>
                    exciting going to Raising Canes for the first time was and how much fun the gay<br>
                    bar was with you (despite the brief crappy event that happened there).
                </p>
            </span></li>
        <li><span>
                <p>
                    Thank you for making me laugh a little in life. Whether it was showing me your<br>
                    favorite tiktoks of the day or sharing me your new cheesy pickup line. I like<br>
                    being silly with you. You make me feel like I can be myself, which is amazing<br>
                    especially since I have a hard time being myself at Olin.
                </p>
            </span></li>
        <li><span>
                <p>
                    Thank you for caring about other people and introducing me to your friends<br>
                    (and cute cats). I love being around your friends and I can tell that they<br>
                    are all awesome people. You all make me feel so comfortable and it finally<br>
                    feels like I have people who understand me and support me. I know that you're<br>
                    the sweetest so I'm not surprised that you also have the sweetest friends who<br>
                    look out for people just like you and genuinely care about each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And finally, I just want to say thank you for being yourself. Your creative, smart,<br>
                    funny, caring, and adorable self. I feel so lucky that we met and that I have you in<br>
                    my life. That I can see your cute face everyday and talk to you and cuddle you.<br>
                    You're a really special person, Kim, and I know that sounds cheesy but I really<br>
                    have never met anyone as amazing as you. I love you.
